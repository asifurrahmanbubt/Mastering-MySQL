# Mastering MySQL ðŸš€  

This repository is my personal journey of learning MySQL. I will document my daily progress, upload SQL queries, and share notes as I explore database management.  

## ðŸ“Œ Why this repo?  
- To track my progress and stay consistent.  
- To build a collection of MySQL queries, notes, and projects.

## ðŸ”¥ Learning Plan  
I will follow a structured approach:  
1. **Basic SQL Queries** - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `WHERE`, etc.  
2. **Joins & Relationships** - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN.  
3. **Aggregate Functions** - COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING.  
4. **Subqueries & Nested Queries**  
5. **Indexes & Performance Optimization**  
6. **Stored Procedures & Functions**  
7. **Triggers & Views**  
8. **Database Design & Normalization**
